# OPC172_CONN
OpenSCAD source for 3D printing the ICOM OPC172 fiber optic connector housing

The two "prongs" that fix the mating ends of the fibers are printed 1/16" longer than the desired finished size
to allow "elaphant's foot" artifacts to be more easily removed.  Finished length of the "prongs" is 0.125".

The fiber holes need to be chased with a 0.04" drill (preferrable on a drill press) to ensure proper clearance
for the fibers.  Also, the jacket holes need to be chased with a 0.09" diameter drill bit, 0.39" deep.

Use broadcom cable for replacement cables.  PN HFBR-RMD005Z is a cable assembly that is inexpensive (the included
connectors are discarded).  Other lengths are available.  Also, the raw cable can be purchased from some distributors
in cut lengths.  The raw cable is PN HFBR-RUD100Z (100m).

Secure the cable to the housing with an over-wrap tape (such as 3M Scotch-88) and small cable ties.
